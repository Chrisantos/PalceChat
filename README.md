Palce is a chat app I built using Firebase, believe me, it wasn't an easy task(building a chat app with Firebase).

So what does Palce do?

Palce doesn't really do much, just the basic stuffs all Chat apps do.
And these are:

Palce enables you chat with your friends and family in real-time..
You can send a friend request to a user of Palce who either accepts your request or declines it. 
You also get an instant notification when ever a user sends you a request. 
You also can clear your previous chat history with just a click.

I believe, ideas rule the world, so with Palce you can create a group (open group ) where you can chat and share ideas with multiple users.
You can also clear your previous chat history with just a click.
